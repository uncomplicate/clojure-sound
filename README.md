# Clojure Sound

[Adopt your pet function](https://dragan.rocks/articles/18/Patreon-Announcement-Adopt-a-Function) and [become a patron](https://patreon.com/draganrocks).

Clojure Sound is a library for transforming digital media and communicating with MIDI devices.
It is based on Java Sound API, but improves on Java Sound's UX shortcomings as much as possible,
to provide nice interactive programming experience.

## How to use it

I haven't written documentation for each function yet, but the whole [Java Sound tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/TOC.html) is covered as [midje tests](https://github.com/uncomplicate/clojure-sound/tree/master/test/clojure/uncomplicate/clojure_sound), which is even more useful because it shows how each function works in context of real use cases.
